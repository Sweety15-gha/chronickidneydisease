Early Prediction for Chronic Kidney Disease Detection: A Progressive Approach to Health Management
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant medical problem that can be managed effectively if detected in its early stages. This project investigates how attributes from various routine medical tests, which are often overlooked, can contain valuable information for the early detection and management of kidney disease. By analyzing this data, we aim to measure the severity of the problem, predict patient survival, understand disease progression patterns, and ultimately support effective treatment.

Project Scenarios
This project explores three key scenarios for leveraging predictive analysis in CKD management:

Scenario 1: Early Detection through Routine Tests
A patient visits a clinic for a routine health check-up. The system analyzes standard blood and urine test results, such as abnormal creatinine and albumin levels. These indicators help detect CKD at an early stage, enabling timely treatment to prevent the disease from progressing.

Scenario 2: Predicting Disease Severity and Survival
Using AI to analyze historical patient data, the system can predict disease severity and potential survival outcomes for a newly diagnosed CKD patient. This analysis is based on test attributes like GFR, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine, which helps doctors plan more targeted and effective treatment strategies.

Scenario 3: Monitoring Disease Progression
For a patient with a CKD diagnosis, the system continuously tracks changes in key biomarkers from regular follow-up tests. By monitoring these patterns over time, the system can alert the physician to a worsening trend, allowing for timely adjustments to the treatment plan and reducing the risk of kidney failure.
